### 1. 痘痘护理
**A:** Why do you have a `band-aid`(创可贴) on your face? 
**B:** It's not a bind-aid, it's an `acne patch`(痘痘贴). I have a big `pimple`(青春痘) here, and I'm hoping the patch will make it go away faster.
**A:** Oh, I haven't had acne problems since high school. In high school, I had really bad acne.
**B:** What did you do about it?
**A:** I bought `over-the-counter medicine`(非处方药) at the `pharmacy`(药店). When that didn't work, I saw a `dermatologist`(皮肤科医生) regularly and took `prescription drugs`(处方药).
**B:** Did it help?
**A:** It helped some, but my acne only completely cleared after high school. Then I had to get `laser treatment` to get rid of the `acne scars`(痘疤)?
**B:** Thanks for sharing.
